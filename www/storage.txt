// Get current username
var user = firebase.auth().currentUser;

// Create a Storage Ref w/ username
var storageRef = firebase.storage().ref(user + '/profilePicture/' + file.name);

// Upload file
var task = storageRef.put(file);
So if the user is user:12345 and the file name is profile.jpg, then the file will be saved as user:12345/profilePicture/profile.jpg. You can protect this with Security Rules as follows:
service firebase.storage {
  match /b/<your-firebase-storage-bucket>/o {
    match /{userId}/profilePicture/{fileName} {
      // Anyone can read
      allow read;
      // Only the user can upload their own profile picture
      // Profile picture must be of content-type "image/*"
      allow write: if request.auth.uid == userId
                   && request.resource.contentType.matches('image/.+');
    }
  }
}
